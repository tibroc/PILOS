## Introduction

PILOS can ask an external meeting summary service to transcribe and summarize meetings.
An open source summary service with this interface is [bbb-recap](https://github.com/virtUOS/bbb-recap); it also provides the recording exporter for the BigBlueButton servers.
The summary is delivered to the room owner by the summary service, for example as a document in a document editor.
PILOS itself does not process the recording; it only marks the meeting at BigBlueButton and tells the summary service who the owner is.
Meeting summaries do not require the recording setting of the room.

When a meeting starts in a room with meeting summaries enabled, PILOS:

1. sends `record=true` to BigBlueButton, even if the recording of the video conference is disabled for the room (BigBlueButton only exports meetings with recording marks),
2. adds the meta parameters `meta_<prefix>-v=1`, `meta_<prefix>-enabled=true`, `meta_<prefix>-type` and `meta_<prefix>-sink` to the BigBlueButton `create` call,
3. stores the internal meeting ID returned by BigBlueButton (the ID of the later recording),
4. registers the room owner with the summary service in a queued job (`PUT /api/v1/registrations/{internal meeting id}`).

The BigBlueButton server needs a recording exporter that sends the raw recordings of these meetings to the summary service.
Only meetings with both the meta parameters and a registration are summarized.

When a room is deleted, PILOS cancels the registrations of its meetings in a queued job (`DELETE /api/v1/registrations/{internal meeting id}`).
A summary that has already been delivered is not withdrawn; it belongs to the owner.
Transferring the room ownership does not change existing registrations: the summary goes to the owner at the time the meeting was started.

## Requirements

- The summary service is reachable from PILOS, and a bearer token for this PILOS instance is set up there.
- Users log in via [OpenID Connect](./01-external-authentication.md). The summary service identifies the owner by the OpenID Connect subject (`sub`), which PILOS stores at each OpenID Connect login.
  The meeting summary setting is unavailable to a room owner until they have logged in via OpenID Connect once.
- The queue workers (Horizon) are running, as registrations are sent by queued jobs.

## Setup

### 1. Configure PILOS

Enable meeting summaries by adding the following environment variables to the `.env` file:

```shell
RECAP_ENABLED=true
RECAP_SERVICE_URL=https://recap.domain.tld
RECAP_FRONTEND_TOKEN="token-of-this-pilos-instance"
```

- `RECAP_SERVICE_URL` is the base URL of the summary service; if the API is in a subdirectory, include the full path.
- The feature stays disabled unless `RECAP_ENABLED`, `RECAP_SERVICE_URL` and `RECAP_FRONTEND_TOKEN` are all set.
- `RECAP_META_PREFIX` must be the same prefix as configured in the recording exporter on the BigBlueButton servers.
  It must be a lowercase letter followed by 1-15 lowercase letters or digits; an invalid prefix disables the feature and logs a warning.

### 2. Configure room types

Meeting summaries are configured per room type in the admin UI:

- **Create a meeting summary (AI)**: Default value of the room setting, and whether it is enforced. A room type can enforce meeting summaries off, but it cannot enforce them on.
- **Meeting type**: Name of the meeting type at the summary service, which selects the summary template (e.g. `meeting-summary`).
- **Summary destination**: Name of the sink profile at the summary service the summaries are delivered to (e.g. `docs-main`).

Both names consist of lowercase letters, digits and hyphens and must be configured at the summary service.
Meetings in rooms of a room type without meeting type or destination are never summarized.

Custom create parameters of a room type must not contain `meta_<prefix>-*` parameters, so a room type cannot opt rooms in.

### 3. Room setting

The room owner, and only the room owner, can enable **Create a meeting summary (AI)** in the **Meeting summary (AI)** section of the room settings.
Co-owners and administrators cannot change it.

A meeting is summarized only if, when it starts:

- the feature is enabled,
- the room owner has an OpenID Connect subject,
- the room setting is enabled (and not enforced off by the room type),
- the room type has a meeting type and a summary destination.

The recording setting of the room is not one of these conditions.

Moderators decide which parts of the meeting are summarized: they start and stop the capture with the record button of BigBlueButton.
**Automatic recording start** keeps the value of the room setting, also in meetings with a summary only.
Without recording marks, BigBlueButton does not export the meeting and no summary is created.

### Meetings with a summary but without recording

If the room has meeting summaries enabled but the recording of the video conference disabled:

- The camera video of the participants is never recorded; PILOS does not ask for the consent to record the own video.
- PILOS does not import the playback recording of the meeting. BigBlueButton still creates it, as the meeting is recorded for the summary service,
  but when the recording is imported, PILOS deletes it from the spool directory without storing it and logs one info line with the meeting ID.
  Participants never see a recording nobody asked for.

Meetings with both recording and meeting summary enabled are recorded and imported as before.

## Consent

Participants give one consent before starting or joining a meeting with recording or meeting summary; PILOS refuses the request without it.
The text depends on the meeting:

| Meeting                    | Texts                                                        | Default (English)                                                                                                                                               |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Summary only               | `rooms.recap_info`, `rooms.recap_accept`                     | An AI may transcribe and summarize the audio of this meeting. No recording is published. / I consent to the transcription and AI summary of the audio.          |
| Recording and summary      | `rooms.recording_recap_info`, `rooms.recording_recap_accept` | This room may be recorded, and an AI may transcribe and summarize the audio. / I consent to the recording and to the transcription and AI summary of the audio. |
| Recording only (unchanged) | `rooms.recording_info`, `rooms.recording_accept`             | This room may be recorded. / I consent to the recording.                                                                                                        |

The hint `rooms.recording_hint` (mute the microphone to avoid being recorded) is shown in all three cases.
The optional consent to record the own video (`rooms.recording_video_accept`) is only asked in meetings with recording.

Customize the texts as described in [Locales](../09-customisation/02-locales.md), for example to name the summary service or the data protection notice:

```php
'recap_info' => 'The audio of this meeting may be transcribed and summarized by an AI service of the university. No recording is published.',
```

## Meeting summaries tab

After a meeting with a meeting summary ends, PILOS asks the summary service for the result in a queued job (`GET /api/v1/registrations/{internal meeting id}`).
PILOS notices the end through the signed meeting end callback of BigBlueButton (`meetingEndedURL`) or, if the callback does not arrive, through the server poll within about a minute.
It polls 2, 5, 10 and 30 minutes apart, then hourly, and stops when the result is stored, the registration is not found (404) or cancelled, the job failed or was not delivered, or 24 hours after the meeting end.
Network errors, HTTP 429 and HTTP 5xx count as "not yet" and are polled again on the same schedule; other client errors fail the job.

The result is stored as one meeting summary per meeting and listed in the room tab **Meeting summaries**, newest first.
The tab is shown when meeting summaries are enabled or the room already has summaries.
Depending on the destination configured at the summary service, an entry is one of:

- **Link to a document**, for example in [La Suite Docs](https://github.com/suitenumerique/docs). The document is created in the account of the room owner at the document service, and only people the owner shares it with there can open it.
  Other room members see the entry, but the link only works for them after the owner has shared the document. The tab shows this hint next to the link; the owner sees a hint that the document opens in their own account.
- **Summary text** (destination type `frontend` at the summary service). PILOS fetches the text (`GET …/summary`), stores it, and then confirms the pickup (`DELETE …/summary`), so the summary service deletes its copy.
  The text is available in the room as a Markdown file download (`meeting-summary-<room id>-<date and time>.md`); it is not displayed in the page. To read or edit a formatted summary, use a document destination. Texts larger than 2 MiB or not encoded in UTF-8 are not stored; the pickup is still confirmed.

PILOS stores the first result of a meeting and then stops polling. If an administrator reruns the processing at the summary service after that, the new result is not transferred to PILOS and the stored meeting summary is not updated.

Access works like for recordings:

- Each summary has an access setting (everyone with access to the room, participants, moderators, or owner and co-owners). New summaries start with owner and co-owners only.
- The room owner, co-owners and users with the permission to manage all rooms can change the access and delete a summary. Users with the permission to view all rooms see all summaries.
- Summaries are deleted after the [recording retention period](./03-recording.md#max-retention-period) (application settings) by the `cleanup:recordings` command, with the room, or by the owner or a co-owner.
  A summary is also deleted together with its meeting record in the meeting history, even before the retention period ends.

## Data flow and privacy

| Data                                                                      | Sent to                                       | Personal data                                  |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `meta_<prefix>-*` parameters (version, opt-in, meeting type, destination) | BigBlueButton, part of the recording metadata | none; may be visible to meeting participants   |
| Registration: meeting ID, internal meeting ID, owner `sub` and email      | summary service                               | owner OpenID Connect subject and email address |
| Cancellation on room deletion: internal meeting ID                        | summary service                               | none                                           |
| Result polling: internal meeting ID                                       | summary service                               | none                                           |
| Result: document link or summary text                                     | from the summary service to PILOS             | summary text: names and meeting content        |

- PILOS stores the OpenID Connect subject in the users table, and the meeting summary flag and the internal meeting ID in the meetings table. They are deleted with the user or the meeting.
- PILOS does not store the playback recording of a meeting with a summary but without recording; it deletes the spool file on import.
- The queued jobs contain only model IDs or the internal meeting ID, no subject or email.
- Logs contain only meeting and internal meeting IDs, HTTP status codes and problem types, never the subject, email or token.
- The summary text is stored in the PILOS database (`meeting_summaries` table), available for download according to its access setting, and deleted after the recording retention period, with the room, or by the owner or a co-owner. The document link points to the owner's document; deleting the entry in PILOS does not delete the document.
- The summary text is never written to the logs; logs contain the meeting and summary IDs and the text size only.
- How long the summary service keeps the registration, recording and summary is configured there.

## Retries

Registrations and cancellations are retried for up to one day (after 30 seconds, 60 seconds and then every 5 minutes) on network errors, HTTP 429 and HTTP 5xx.
Other client errors (e.g. 400, 401, 409) are logged with status and problem type, and the job fails without retry.
A late registration is accepted by the summary service.
A cancellation answered with 404 or with 409 `already-delivered` is final.
